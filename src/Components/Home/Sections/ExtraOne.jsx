              The number of websites allowed with a single theme license depends

              on one domain and multiple subdomain, you are free to install and
              activate the theme accordingly. An Extended License provides the
              flexibility to create and use the theme on multiple domains,
              offering a more extensive scope of usage beyond a single website.
